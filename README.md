# üåßÔ∏è Cloudburst Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains my final report for the course *Practicum in Data Analysis*, part of the Columbia QMSS Master‚Äôs Program. The project focuses on predicting cloudburst events using machine learning models applied to NOAA Local Climatological Data (LCD). It combines domain-informed feature engineering, rare-event detection strategies, and model evaluation across multiple algorithms.

## üìò Project Summary

Cloudbursts‚Äîshort but extreme rainfall events‚Äîcan lead to severe flooding and damage, yet are difficult to predict due to their rarity and localized nature. In this project, I used 10 years of hourly weather station data to construct a prediction pipeline. I engineered meteorologically relevant features (e.g., pressure changes, dew point depression, precipitation accumulation), applied models like Random Forests and Autoencoders, and evaluated performance with a focus on rare-event sensitivity.
